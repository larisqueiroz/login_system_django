## Get started
1. Install the required libs

2. Create a new Gmail account.

This project sends emails through Gmail and to do so, the code needs permition. You can do it by editing security settings on your Gmail account. However, it's not cool doing it on your personal account. So, the best choice is to create a new one for this purpose.

Turn this option ON: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

4. Run run.bat or run using an IDE with the command:
```
python chat_system/manage.py runserver
```
